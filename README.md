# nice-chat

This is a very minimal mod that allows you to blacklist certain words from chat.

## Use-Cases

* you want to stream on a no-rules server without having to hide the chat completely
* you don't want to have to `/ignore` every single user that is spamming
* you don't want to have to `/ignore` players that use anti-afk chat messages

## Typical Words

* `discordapp.com`
* `twitch.tv`
* `Hey I am new, anyone has coords to a farm?`

## Installation

This is currently intended for 1.12.2.

* Set up [Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/).
* Go to the Releases page and download the jar (or compile it yourself if you don't trust me, you know the drill)
* Put it in the mods folder
